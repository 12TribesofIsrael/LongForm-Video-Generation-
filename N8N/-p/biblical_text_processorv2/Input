Who was the man the world calls Jesus?
What was his true purpose?
And what exactly did he teach?

Let's open the Scriptures—not church doctrine.
Not man's opinions.
But the Bible.
The 1611 King James Version.

Christ's Hebrew name is **Yahawashi**—and his mission was never random.
It was **precise**, **prophetic**, and **powerful**.

Let's begin with the foundation.

---

**Matthew chapter 15, verse 24:**

*"But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel."*

From his own mouth—Yahawashi said he was sent **only to the lost sheep**.
Who are they?

The twelve tribes of Israel—scattered through captivity, colonization, and slavery.
They lost their language, their land, their laws.
And now? They walk in darkness, not knowing who they are.

But Yahawashi came to awaken them.

---

**Jeremiah chapter 50, verse 6:**

*"My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray..."*

Christ wasn't on a universal mission—he was on a **family mission**.
He was sent by the Father to call **Israel** back to covenant.

---

Now, what was the message he preached?

**Matthew chapter 4, verse 17:**

*"From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."*

Repentance. That was the core.
But what is repentance?

**1 John chapter 3, verse 4 tells us:**

*"Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law."*

So repentance means to **turn from sin**—to **stop breaking God's laws**.

Christ taught that keeping the commandments wasn't optional.
It was essential.

---

**Luke chapter 5, verse 32:**

*"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."*

He didn't come for those who thought they had it all together.
He came for the broken—the lawbreakers—the lost.

But make no mistake…

---

**Matthew chapter 5, verse 17:**

*"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil."*

**Verse 19 continues:**

*"Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven..."*

So many claim Christ "did away with the law."
But he said the opposite.
He fulfilled prophecy—**he didn't erase the commandments**.

He **lived them**.
And he commanded us to do the same.

---

Why was his sacrifice so important?

**Acts chapter 5, verses 30 and 31:**

*"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted... to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins."*

He died for **Israel's sins**.
Not for the world—not at that time.
But for the covenant people.

This matches the prophecy in **Isaiah chapter 53, verse 5:**

*"But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities..."*

Christ fulfilled the role of the sin offering.

---

Let's talk about how he taught.

**Matthew chapter 7, verse 28-29:**

*"The people were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one having authority..."*

He didn't teach like a soft-spoken church pastor.
He taught with boldness—direct from the Scriptures.
He quoted Moses, Isaiah, Psalms, and the prophets.

His doctrine wasn't a new religion—it was the **true understanding** of the Torah.

---

Now here's something most churches won't tell you:

**John chapter 14, verse 15:**

*"If ye love me, keep my commandments."*

To Christ, love isn't a feeling—it's **obedience**.

**1 John chapter 5, verse 3:**

*"For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous."*

So when you say you love Christ—he expects **action**, not just words.

---

And what about peace?

Did he come to bring world unity?

**Luke chapter 12, verse 51:**

*"Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division."*

Yes, division.

Because truth divides.
It separates light from darkness.
Wheat from tares.
Those who obey… from those who rebel.

---

**Hebrews chapter 4, verse 12:**

*"For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword..."*

Christ came to **cut through deception**.
To separate truth from lies.

---

He also made it clear—he was not praying for everyone.

**John chapter 17, verse 9:**

*"I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me..."*

He prayed for his disciples.
For the elect.
For Israel.

Because within Israel, there would be a **remnant** who would wake up.

**Romans chapter 11, verse 5:**

*"Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace."*

---

And what about the gospel?

What message did he say would be preached before the end?

**Matthew chapter 24, verse 14:**

*"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."*

This gospel—the true gospel—is a **witness**.
Not to convert everyone…
But to testify before the nations.

---

Let's summarize.

Christ's true mission was:

* To **gather the lost sheep of Israel**
* To **call them to repentance**
* To **fulfill the law**, not destroy it
* To **die for Israel's sins**
* To **teach with authority and power**
* To **restore obedience to the commandments**
* To **divide truth from falsehood**
* And to **prepare the elect** for the coming kingdom

This was his doctrine.
This was his assignment.

---

He came for **you**, Israel.
Not to entertain.
But to awaken.

And the time… is now.
